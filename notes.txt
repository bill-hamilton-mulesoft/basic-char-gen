Why this project exists.

From _First Things First_, there are four human needs and capacities: *To Live, To Love, To Learn, To Leave a Legacy*. The “Why” here is *To Learn*. The “What” in my job can mostly be handled by passing information around. It will pay the bills and assist a lot with the *To Live*, but only passively trickle feeds the *To Learn*. This Heroku First Project is an active effort to inject energy into the *To Learn* bucket for a happier life. Aside from this overarching purpose, I can explain the under whys:

* *Why Heroku*
    * It is a valuable platform to know for current and future *To Live* efforts.
    * It is a perk of employment with Salesforce that I have an account to use free of charge for this purpose.
    * Knowing it enables me to offer up authentic cross-sell opportunities. “Here is how MuleSoft can access a Heroku-hosted service.”
    * Forces me to keep important dissolving knowledge fresh and available:
        * GitHub
        * Javascript/node.js, or Python (still need to pick one)
        * HTML
        * OAS/Swagger
        * PostgreSQL - when at that stage
* *Appreciation of the value of MuleSoft*. From the videos I have watched on creators walking its viewers through simple solutions, I have learned it takes a lot to make a little happen from a service creation perspective. It will serve me well to not only know this but feel it.
* *Increase my confidence in myself*. Know that I can still do this and do it well. 
* *Keep me competitive with my peers*. I don’t want to feel like, be seen as, or actually be the one that can do nothing but deliver presentation slides and track down questions from experts.
* *Offer up to my team that I can contribute something unique* that they can’t (Heroku expert capable SE) when that is needed.
* Have this such that I *have an asset* to include other key knowledge efforts.
